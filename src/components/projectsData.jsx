    title:'Portfolio V1',
    tools:'React • JavaScript • CSS',
    dateCreated:'June 2023',
    description:"This is an earlier version of my portfolio site. It was unlike projects I'd undertaken within the confines of a course, it empowered me to envision and construct a website according to my personal aesthetic. Although I devoted a substantial amount of time into this project, my design-as-I-went approach proved to be less efficient. This realisation led me to adopt Figma for the design phase of my current portfolio. Nevertheless, creating version one of my portfolio was very beneficial for my growth. It not only allowed me to apply principles I had learned previously but also introduced me to a broader range of React principles to harness in my projects.",

    title:'Meme Generator',
    tools:'React • JavaScript • CSS • API',
    dateCreated:'May 2023',
    description:"During my course with Scrimba, I successfully completed a project that allowed me to apply several important concepts in React, including useState, useEffect, props, and APIs. The project involved creating a meme generator with two input fields, one for the top text and another for the bottom text. These inputs dynamically displayed the user's text on a meme image. Additionally, I implemented a button to generate a new random meme image by fetching data from a meme image API. This project provided hands-on experience in integrating APIs and managing state in React applications.",

    title:"Restaurant App",
    tools:"JavaScript • HTML • CSS",
    dateCreated:'January 2023',
    description:"I developed a restaurant ordering app using vanilla JavaScript. The app enables users to add items to their cart, remove items from the cart, and proceed to checkout. As items are added or removed, the app dynamically updates the total price of each item and the overall cart total. This project provided valuable insights into displaying elements on a webpage in response to button clicks. It was an engaging experience to witness the real-time updates and calculations based on user interactions.",

    title:"Unit Converter",
    tools:"JavaScript • HTML • CSS",
    dateCreated:'October 2022',
    description:"I created one of my first JavaScript apps that performs unit conversions. It allows you to enter a number in the input field and converts it into different units, such as meters/feet, liters/gallons, and kilos/pounds. It was a great learning experience for me to practice JavaScript programming and understand how to handle unit conversions in a web application.",

    description:"For our final project at Le Wagon, my team and I created a plant swapping and donation platform. It featured a live chat for easy communication and utilized map APIs for convenient local connections. We focused on creating an intuitive user interface and tackled challenges like user authentication and database optimization. The project showcased our ability to combine plant enthusiasm with modern technology for a meaningful and engaging platform.",
