          Hey, I'm Morton, a 28 year old from a small village called Llangrannog in West Wales.
          In Febuary 2022, I made the exciting move to London to pursue a career in the tech industry.
          Let me share a bit about my journey of how I got to where I am today.

        <p className='sheet-text'>
        From an early age, Iâ€™ve been captivated by the potential of technology. At the age of 14, I taught myself to jailbreak my iPhone,
        curious in how I could push the boundless possibilities of tech beyond its widely accepted limitations.
        This inquiring nature has anchored all of my future endeavours, even in my later years, as my financial needs
        demanded a quick pivot into the limited job opportunities in my small village of west Wales, predominantly centred
        around seasonal tourism and customer service. But what I gained from them was invaluable: An ability to adapt swiftly
        to various environments, instilling in me a keen aptitude for rapidly acquiring new skills and knowledge. Even in these
        capacities, whether it has been introducing online resources into training processes as a Lifeguard, or establishing
        new workflows and system as a valet, I have proactively sought innovative approaches to problem-solving at every job
        I occupied. The flexible and varied nature of these roles afforded me the liberty to indulge in my passion for travel.
        Throughout my early 20s, I had the privilege of exploring numerous countries, immersing myself in diverse cultures,
        sampling amazing cuisines, and surfing some of the world's most renowned waves.

        During the lockdown, I had the privilege of living with a close friend who happened to be a web developer. It was during
        this time that my eyes were reopened to the world of technology. My friend guided me in exploring coding for myself, and
        I was instantly captivated. The process of turning abstract lines of code, which initially seemed like gibberish to me,
        into tangible web elements was incredibly satisfying.
        As the lockdown restrictions eased, I made the decision to pursue this desire further. I uprooted my entire life:
        I moved to London, and enrolled in a web development bootcamp at Le Wagon, where I acquired a comprehensive understanding
        of web development, which included proficiency in various programming languages, frameworks, and tools. I also learned
        valuable collaborative skills, honed through teamwork and Git usage. I further solidified knowledge with another course
         with Scrimba, In which I honed in on frontend web development, gaining skills in React.js. Now, with a robust foundation
          in web development I am confident in, I crave a professional environment that can marry my rich technical skillset and my
           hunger to apply it.
